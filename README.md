# AINEQUAL: Stata module to compute measures of inequality

## Abstract
ainequal computes a series of inequality measures of the variables in varlist. It is a revised and
upgraded version of inequal7 and inequal published by Edward Whitehouse in STB-23.

The inequality measures computed are: the "relative mean deviation", the "coefficient of variation",
the "standard deviation of logs", the"Gini index", the "Mehran index", the "Piesch index", the
"Kakwani index", "Theil entropy index", the "mean log deviation", the "generalised entropy measure"
for all sensitivity [see, e.g., Cowell [1995] and Amiel and Cowell [1999] for a definition of these
measures], the "Atkinson Inequality Index" using the inequality aversion parameter epslon, and the
"Donaldson-Weymark relative S-Gini" using the distributional sensitivity paramether delta.

In addition ainequal also computes the relative poverty line proposed by Hoffmann [2001] and Lambert
and Lanza [2006], for the Gini, Theil-T and Theil-L.
